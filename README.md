Zmeet is a Node.js Zoom Meetings app that allows you to quickly create, start, and share new meetings without the zoom app. 

It takes away the complexity of advanced meeting settings. It allows you to share only what you need for zoom meetings with internal teams, friends and colleagues, namely topic, date and time, and the meeting url link.
